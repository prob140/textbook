But estimates based on even such simple probabilistic models proved to be quite a bit [more accurate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem#Specific_data) than those based on the intelligence gathered by the Allies. For example, in August 1942, intelligence estimates were that Germany was producing 1,550 tanks per month. The prediction based on the probability model was 327 per month. After the war, German records showed that the actual production rate was 342 per month.\n",
