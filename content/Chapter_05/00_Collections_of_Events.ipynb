    "Most questions in data science involve multiple variables and events. Random variables and their joint distributions give us a way to set up probabilistic models for how our data originate. Some techniques are particularly useful for working with large collections of variables and events. These include:\n",
    "- Using bounds when exact values are difficult to calculate\n",
    "- Noticing patterns when working with small collections and then generalizing to larger ones\n",
    "- Using symmetry, both for insight and for simplifying calculation\n",

    "In this chapter we will study powerful examples of all these techniques. "
