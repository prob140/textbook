    "**3.** *Capture-recapture* methods are sometimes used to estimate population sizes. A standard image is that a pond contains $N$ fish for some fixed but unknown $N$, and that $G$ of the $N$ fish have been captured, tagged, and returned alive to the pond. \n",
    "\n",

    "(a) For large $n$, the sample proportion $X/n$ is likely to be close to a constant. Identify the constant and hence construct an estimate of $N$ based on $X$. Later in this exercise you will see how your estimate is related to the MLE of $N$.\n",
