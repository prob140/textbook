    "People have long been fascinated by encryption and decryption, well before cybersecurity became part of our lives. Decoding encrypted information can be complex and computation intensive. Reversed Markov Chains can help us in this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sense of one approach to solving such problems, and of the extent of the task, let's try to decode a short piece of text that has been encoded using a simple code called a *substituion code*. Text is written in an *alphabet*, which you can think of as a set of letters and punctuation. In a substitution code, each letter of the alphabet is simply replaced by another in such a way that the code is just a permutation of the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decode a message encrypted by a substitution code, you have to *invert* the permutation that was used. In other words, you have to apply a permutation to the *coded* message in order to recover the original text. We will call this permutation the *decoder*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decode a textual message, we have to make some assumptions. For example, it helps to know the language in which the message was written, and what combinations of letters are common in that language. For example, suppose we try to decode a message that was written in English and then encrypted. If our decoding process ends up with \"words\" like zzxtf and tbgdgaa, we might want to try a different way.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need data about which sequences of letters are common. Such data are now increasingly easy to gather; see for example this [web page](http://norvig.com/ngrams/) by [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com), a Director of Research at Google. "

    "Let's see how we can use such an approach to decode a message. For simplicity, suppose our alphabet consists of only three letters: a, d, and t. Now suppose we get the coded message atdt. We believe it's an English word. How can we go about decoding it in a manner that can be replicated by a computer for other words too?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, we will write down all 3! = 6 possible permutations of the letters in the alphabet and use each one to decode the message. The table `decoding` contains all the results. Each entry in the `Decoder` column is a permutation that we will apply to our coded text atdt. The permutation determines which letters we will use as substitutes in our decoding process. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "You can read the rest of the table in the same way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in each decoded message, a letter appears twice, at indices 1 and 3. That's the letter being used to decode t in atdt. A feature of substitution codes is that each letter *original* is coded by a letter *code*, with the same letter *code* being used every time the letter *original* appears in the text. So the decoder must have the same feature."

    "What we have been able to do with an alphabet of three characters becomes daunting when the alphabet is larger. The 52 lower case and upper case letters, along with a space character and all the punctuations, form an alphabet of around 70 characters. That gives us 70! different decoders to consider. In theory, we have to find the likelihood of each of these 70! candidates and sort them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the number 70!. That's a lot of decoders. Our computing system can't handle that many, and other systems will have the same problem."

    "One potential solution is to sample at random from these 70! possible decoders and just pick from among the sampled permutations. But how should we draw from 70! items? It's not a good idea to choose uniform random permutations of the alphabet, as those are unlikely to get us quickly to the desired solution. \n",

    "What we would really like our sampling procedure to do is to choose good decoders with high probability. A good decoder is one that generates text that has higher probability than text produced by almost all other decoders. In other words, a good decoder has higher likelihood than other decoders, given the data.\n",

    "You can write down this likelihood using Bayes' Rule. Let $S$ represent the space of all possible permutations; if the alphabet has $N$ characters, then $S$ has $N!$ elements. For any randomly picked permutation $j$, the likelihood of that decoder given the data is:\n",

In our example with the three-letter alphabet, we ignored it because we could figure out the numerators for all six decoders and just compare them. The numerator was what we called the *score* of the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when the alphabet is large, for any particular decoder $j$ we can find the numerator by multiplying transition probabilities sequentially, as we did in our example. But with a large alphabet we can't do this for all possible decoders, so we can't list all possible scores and we can't add them all up. Therefore we don't know the denominator of the likelihoods, not even upto a decent approximation.\n",
