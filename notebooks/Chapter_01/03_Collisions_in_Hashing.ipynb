    "In computer science, *hash functions* assign a code called a *hash value* to each of a set of individuals. It's important that each individual be assigned a unique value. If two individuals are assigned the same value, there is a *collision*, and this causes trouble in identification. Yet it is cumbersome to keep track of which hash values have and have not been assigned, as the numbers of hash values and individuals can be very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the hash values were just assigned at random, without taking into account which of them have already been assigned? If there are a large number of distinct values and a relatively small number of individuals, then it seems reasonable to think that the chance of a collision will be small. For example, if there are 1,000 available hash values and only 5 individuals, it doesn't seem likely that you'll get a collision if you just pick a random sequence of 5 values for the 5 individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make some assumptions about randomness and find the probability that there is no collision. Assume that there are $N$ hash values and $n$ individuals, and suppose your hash function is such that all $N^n$ assignments of values to individuals are equally likely. An assignment is a sequence $a_0 a_1 \\ldots a_n$ where for each $i$, individual $i$ is assigned the hash value $a_i$.\n",
    "\n",
