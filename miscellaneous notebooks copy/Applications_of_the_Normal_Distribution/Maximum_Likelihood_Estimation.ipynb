    "### Maximum Likelihood Estimation ###\n",
    "Suppose you have an i.i.d. sample $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ where the density of each $X_i$ depends on a parameter $\\theta$. The method of *maximum likelihood* estimates $\\theta$ by answering the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Among all the possible values of the parameter $\\theta$, which one maximizes the likeihood of getting our sample?\n",
    "\n",
    "That maximizing value of the parameter is called the *maximum likelihood estimate* or MLE for short. In this section we will develop a method for finding MLEs. \n",
    "\n",
    "First let's do a quick numerical example to illustrate the main idea. Suppose you know that your sample is drawn from the normal $(\\mu, 1)$ distribution for an unknown $\\mu$, and suppose the sampled values are 52.8, 51.1, 54.2, and 52.5. That's a small sample but it carries information. If you had to choose between 32 and 52 as values for $\\mu$, which would you choose? Without any calculation it's clear that 32 is not a good choice: the normal $(32, 1)$ distribution is unlikely to produce values as large as the observed sample. If 32 and 52 are your only two choices for $\\mu$, you should choose 52. But of course $\\mu$ could be any number. To find the best one, you have to do a calculation."
