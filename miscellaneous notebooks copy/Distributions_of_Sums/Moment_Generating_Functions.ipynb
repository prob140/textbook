    "### Moment Generating Functions ###\n",
    "The probability mass function and probability density, cdf, and survival functions are all ways of specifying probability distributions. They are all defined as probabilities or as probability per unit length, and thus have natural interpretations and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are also more abstract ways of describing distributions. One such way that you have encountered is the probability generating function (pgf), which we defined for random variables with finitely many non-negative integer values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now define another such *transform* of a distribution. More general than the pgf, it is a powerful tool for studying distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be a random variable. The *moment generating function* (mgf) of $X$ is a function defined on the real numbers by the formula\n",

    "for all $t$ for which the expectation is finite. It is a fact (which we will not prove) that the domain of the mgf has to be an interval, not necessarily finite but necessarily including 0 because $M_X(0) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $X$ with finitely many non-negative integer values, we had defined the pgf by $G_X(s) = E(s^X)$. Notice that this is a special case of the mgf with $s = e^t$ and hence positive. For a random variable $X$ that has both a pgf $G_X$ and an mgf $M_X$, the two functions are related by $M_X(\\log(s)) = G_X(s)$. Therefore the properties of $M_X$ near 0 reflect the properties of $G_X$ near 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section presents three ways in which the mgf is useful. Other ways are demonstrated in the subsequent sections of this chapter. Much of what we say about mgf's will not be accompanied by complete proofs as the math required is beyond the scope of this class. But the results should seem reasonable, even without formal proofs.\n",
    "\n",

You saw in Data 8 and again in this course that the mean $E(X)$ is the center of gravity of the probability histogram of $X$. In physics, the center of mass is called the *first moment*. The terminology of moments is used in probability theory as well.\n",

    "### Identifying the Distribution ###\n",
    "In this class we have made heavy use of the first and second moments, and no use at all of the higher moments. That will continue to be the case. But mgf's do involve all the moments, and this results in a property that is very useful for proving facts about distributions:\n",

But if you know the moment generating function, and hence all the moments, then you can.\n",
