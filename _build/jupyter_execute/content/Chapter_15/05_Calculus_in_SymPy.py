# ## Calculus in SymPy ##

# Working with densities involves calculus which can sometimes be time-consuming. This course gives you two ways of reducing the amount of calculus involved.
# 
# - Probabilistic methods can help reduce algebra and calculus. You've seen this with algebra in the discrete case. You'll see it with calculus as we learn more about densities.
# - Python has a symbolic math module called `SymPy` that does algebra, calculus, and much other symbolic math. In this section we will show you how to do calculus using `SymPy`.

# We will demonstrate the methods in the context of an example. Suppose $X$ has density given by
# 
# $$
# f(x) = 
# \begin{cases}
# 105x^2(1-x)^4 ~~~ \text{if } 0 \le x \le 1 \\
# 0 ~~~~~~~~~ \text{otherwise}
# \end{cases}
# $$
# 
# As you can see from its graph below, $f$ could be used to model the distribution of a random proportion that you think is likely to be somewhere between 0.2 and 0.4.

# In[2]:


# NO CODE
x_vals = np.arange(0, 1.01, 0.01)
f = 105 * x_vals**2 * (1 - x_vals)**4
plt.plot(x_vals, f, color='darkblue', lw=2)
plt.xlabel('$x$')
plt.ylabel('$f(x)$', rotation=0);


# The density $f$ is a polynomial on the unit interval, and in principle the algebra and calculus involved in integrating it are straightforward. But they are tedious. So let's get `SymPy` to do the work.
# 
# First, we will import all the functions in `SymPy` and set up some printing methods that make the output look nicer than the retro typewritten pgf output you saw in a previous section. In future sections of this text, you can assume that this importing and initialization will have been done at the start.

# In[3]:


from sympy import *
init_printing()


# Next, we have to create tell Python that an object is symbolic. In our example, the variable $x$ is the natural candidate to be a symbol. You can use `Symbol` for this, by using the argument `'x'`. We have assinged the symbol to the name `x`.

# In[4]:


x = Symbol('x')


# Now we will assign the name `density` to the expression that defines $f$. The expression looks just like a numerical calculation, but the output is algebraic!

# In[5]:


density = 105 * x**2 * (1-x)**4
density


# That's the expression for $f(x)$ defined by the equation at the start of the section. Notice that what we naturally think of as $1 - x$ is expressed as $-x + 1$. That's because `SymPy` is writing the polynomial leading with the term of highest degree.
# 
# Let's not simply accept that this function is a density. Let's check that it is a density by integrating it from 0 to 1. To display this, we use the method `Integral` that takes the name of a function and a *tuple* (a sequence in parentheses) consisting of the variable of integration and the lower and upper limits of integration. We have assigned this integral to the name `total_area`.

# In[6]:


total_area = Integral(density, (x, 0, 1))
total_area


# The output of displays the integral, which is nice, but what we really want is its numerical value. In `SymPy`, this is achieved by abruptly instructing the method to `doit()`.

# In[7]:


total_area.doit()


# This confirms that the function $f$ is a density.
# 
# We can use `Integral` to find the chance that $X$ is in any interval. Here is $P(0.2 < X < 0.4)$.

# In[8]:


prob_02_04 = Integral(density, (x, 0.2, 0.4)).doit()
prob_02_04


# For $x$ in the unit interval, the cdf of $X$ is
# 
# $$
# F(x) ~ = ~ P(X \le x) ~ = ~ \int_0^x f(s)ds ~ = ~ I(s)~ \Big{\rvert}_0^x ~ = ~ I(x) - I(0)
# $$
# 
# where $I$ is the indefinite integral of $f$.
# 
# To get the indefinite integral, simply ask `SymPy` to integrate the density; there are no limits of integration.

# In[9]:


indefinite = Integral(density).doit()
indefinite


# Now $F(x) = I(x) - I(0)$. You can see at a glance that $I(0) = 0$ but here is how `SymPy` would figure that out.
# 
# To evaluate $I(0)$, `SymPy` must substitute $x$ with 0 in the expression for $I$. This is achieved by the method `subs` that takes the variable as its first argument and the specified value as the second.

# In[10]:


I_0 = indefinite.subs(x, 0)
I_0


# In[11]:


cdf = indefinite - I_0
cdf


# To find the value of the cdf at a specified point, say 0.4, we have to substitute $x$ with 0.4 in the formula for the cdf. 

# In[12]:


cdf_at_04 = cdf.subs(x, 0.4)
cdf_at_04


# Thus $P(X \le 0.4)$ is roughly 58%. Earlier we calulated $P(0.2 < X < 0.4) = 43.2\%$, which we can confirm by using the cdf:

# In[13]:


cdf_at_02 = cdf.subs(x, 0.2)
cdf_at_04 - cdf_at_02


# The expectation $E(X)$ is a definite integral from 0 to 1:

# In[14]:


expectation = Integral(x*density, (x, 0, 1)).doit()
expectation


# Notice how simple the answer is. Later in the course, you will see why.
# 
# Here is $E(X^2)$, which turns out to be another simple fraction. Clearly, the density $f$ has interesting properties. We will study them later. For now, let's just get the numerical answers.

# In[15]:


expected_square = Integral((x**2)*density, (x, 0, 1)).doit()
expected_square


# Now you can find $SD(X)$.

# In[16]:


sd = (expected_square - expectation**2)**0.5
sd


# ### SymPy and the Exponential Density ###
# One of the primary distributions in probability theory, the exponential distribution has a positive parameter $\lambda$ known as the "rate", and density given by
# 
# $$
# f(t) ~ = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}, ~~~ t \ge 0
# $$
# 
# The density is 0 on the negative numbers. Here is its graph when $\lambda = 3$.

# In[17]:


# NO CODE

lam = 3
tt = np.arange(0, 2.01, 0.01)
f = lam * np.exp(-1*lam*tt)
plt.plot(tt, f, color='darkblue', lw=2)
plt.xlabel('$t$')
plt.ylabel('$f(t)$', rotation=0)
plt.title('Exponential Density, Rate $\lambda = 3$');


# To check that $f$ is a density, we have to confirm that its integral is 1. We will start by constructing two symbols, `t` and `lamda`. Notice the incorrectly spelled `lamda` instead of `lambda`. That is because `lambda` has another meaning in Python, as some of you might know.
# 
# Note the use of `positive=True` to specify that the symbol can take on only positive values.

# In[18]:


t = Symbol('t', positive=True)
lamda = Symbol('lamda', positive=True)


# Next we construct the expression for the density. Notice the use of `exp` for the exponential function. 

# In[19]:


expon_density = lamda * exp(-lamda * t)
expon_density


# To see that the function is a density, we can check that its integral from 0 to $\infty$ is 1. The symbol that `SymPy` uses for $\infty$ is `oo`, a double lower case o. It looks very much like $\infty$.

# In[20]:


Integral(expon_density, (t, 0, oo)).doit()


# Suppose $T$ has the exponential $(\lambda)$ density. Then for $t \ge 0$ the cdf of $T$ is 
# 
# $$
# F_T(t) ~ = ~ P(T \le t) ~ = ~ \int_0^t \lambda e^{-\lambda s}ds
# $$
# 
# This is a straightforward integral that you can probably do in your head. However, let's get some more practice using `SymPy` to find cdf's.
# We will use the same method that we used to find the cdf in the previous example.
# 
# $$
# \int_0^t \lambda e^{-\lambda s}ds ~ = ~ I(t) - I(0)
# $$
# 
# where $I$ is the indefinite integral of the density. To get this indefinite integral we will use `Integral` as before, except that this time we must specify `t` as the variable of integration. That is because `SymPy` sees two symbols `t` and `lamda` in the density, and doesn't know which one is the variable unless we tell it.

# In[21]:


indefinite = Integral(expon_density, t).doit()
indefinite


# Now use $F_T(t) = I(t) - I(0)$:

# In[22]:


I_0 = indefinite.subs(t, 0)
I_0


# In[23]:


cdf = indefinite - I_0
cdf


# Thus the cdf of $T$ is
# 
# $$
# F_T(t) ~ = ~ 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
# $$
# 
# The expectation of $T$ is
# 
# $$
# E(T) ~ = ~ \int_0^\infty t \lambda e^{-\lambda t} dt ~ = ~ \frac{1}{\lambda}
# $$
# 
# which you can check by integration by parts. But `SymPy` is faster:

# In[24]:


expectation = Integral(t*expon_density, (t, 0, oo)).doit()
expectation


# Calculating $E(T^2)$ is just as easy.

# In[25]:


expected_square = Integral(t**2 * expon_density, (t, 0, oo)).doit()
expected_square


# The variance and SD follow directly.

# In[26]:


variance = expected_square - (expectation ** 2)
variance


# In[27]:


sd = variance ** 0.5
sd


# That's a pretty funny way of writing $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ but we'll take it. It's a small price to pay for not having to do all the integrals by hand.
