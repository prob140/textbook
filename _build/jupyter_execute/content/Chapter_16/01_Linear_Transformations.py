# ## Linear Transformations ##

# Linear transformations are both simple and ubiquitous: every time you change units of measurement, for example to standard units, you are performing a linear transformation.

# ### Linear Transformation: Exponential Density ###
# 
# Let $T$ have the exponential $(\lambda)$ distribution and let $T_1 = \lambda T$. Then $T_1$ is a linear transformation of $T$. Therefore
# 
# $$
# E(T_1) = \lambda E(T) = 1 ~~~ \text{and} ~~~ SD(T_1) = \lambda SD(T) = 1
# $$
# 
# The parameter $\lambda$ has disappeared in these results. Let's see how that follows from the distribution of $T_1$. The cdf of $T_1$ is 
# 
# $$
# F_{T_1}(t) = P(T_1 \le t) = P(T \le t/\lambda) = 1 - e^{-\lambda (t/\lambda)}
# = 1 - e^{-t}
# $$
# 
# That's the cdf of the exponential $(1)$ distribution, consistent with the expectation and SD we found above.
# 
# To summarize, if $T$ has the exponential $(\lambda)$ distribution then the distribution of $T_1 = \lambda T$ is exponential $(1)$.
# 
# You can think of the exponential $(1)$ distribution as the fundamental member of the family of exponential distributions. All others in the family can be found by changing the scale of measurement, that is, by multiplying by a constant. 
# 
# If $T_1$ has the exponential $(1)$ distribution, then $T = \frac{1}{\lambda}T_1$ has the exponential $(\lambda)$ distribution. The factor $1/\lambda$ is called the *scale parameter*. 
# 
# Here are graphs of the densities of $T_1$ and $T = \frac{1}{2}T_1$. By the paragraph above, $T$ has the exponential $(2)$ distribution.

# The formulas for the two densities are
# 
# $$
# f_{T_1} (s) = e^{-s} ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ f_T(t) = 2e^{-2t}
# $$
# 
# Let's try to understand the relation between these two densities in a way that will help us generalize what we are seeing in this example. 
# 
# The relation between the two random variables is $T = \frac{1}{2}T_1$.
# 
# - For any $t$, the chance that $T$ is near $t$ is the same as the chance that $T_1$ is near $s = 2t$. This explains the factor $e^{-2t}$ in the density of $T$.
# - If we think of $T_1$ as a point on the horizontal axis, then to create $T$ you have to divide $T_1$ by $2$. So the transformation consists of halving all distances on the horizontal axis. The total area under the density of $T$ must equal $1$, so we have to compensate by doubling all distances on the vertical axis. This explains the factor $2$ in the density of $T$.

# ### Linear Change of Variable Formula for Densities ###
# We use the same idea to find the density of a linear transformation of a random variable.
# 
# Let $X$ be a random variable with density $f_X$, and let $Y = aX + b$ for constants $a \ne 0$ and $b$. Let $f_Y$ be the density of $Y$. Then
# 
# $$
# f_Y(y) ~ = ~ f_X\big{(} \frac{y-b}{a}\big{)} \frac{1}{\lvert a \rvert} 
# $$
# 
# Let's take this formula in two pieces, as in the exponential example.
# - For $Y$ to be $y$, $X$ has to be $(y-b)/a$.
# - The linear function $y = ax+b$ involves multiplying distances along the horizontal axis by $\lvert a \rvert$; the sign of $a$ doesn't affect distances. To get a density, we have to compensate by dividing all vertical distances by $\lvert a \rvert$.
# 
# This is a good way to understand the formula, and will help you understand the corresponding formula for non-linear transformations.
# 
# For a formal proof, start with the case $a > 0$.
# 
# $$
# F_Y(y) = P(aX+b \le y) = P\big{(}X \le \frac{y-b}{a}\big{)} = F_X\big{(}\frac{y-b}{a}\big{)}
# $$
# 
# By the chain rule of differentiation,
# 
# $$
# f_Y(y) = f_X\big{(}\frac{y-b}{a}\big{)} \cdot \frac{1}{a}
# $$
# 
# If $a < 0$ then division by $a$ causes the direction of the inequality to switch:
# 
# $$
# F_Y(y) = P(aX+b \le y) = P\big{(}X \ge \frac{y-b}{a}\big{)} = 1 - F_X\big{(}\frac{y-b}{a}\big{)}
# $$
# 
# Now the chain rule yields
# 
# $$
# f_Y(y) ~ = ~ -f_X\big{(}\frac{y-b}{a}\big{)} \cdot \frac{1}{a}
# ~ = ~ f_X\big{(}\frac{y-b}{a}\big{)} \cdot \frac{1}{\lvert a \rvert}
# $$

# ```{admonition} Quick Check
# $V$ has density $f$ on the whole real line.
# 
# (a) Write the density of $W = 5 + 3V$ in terms of $f$.
# 
# (b) Write the density of $W = 5 - 3V$ in terms of $f$.

# ```{admonition} Answer
# :class: dropdown
# (a) For all $w$, $f_W(w) = f\big{(}\frac{w-5}{3}\big{)}\cdot\frac{1}{3}$
# 
# (b) For all $w$, $f_W(w) = f\big{(}\frac{w-5}{-3}\big{)}\cdot\frac{1}{3}$
# 
# ```

# ### The Normal Densities ###
# Let $Z$ have the standard normal density 
# 
# $$
# \phi(z) ~ = ~ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2}, ~~~ -\infty < z < 
# \infty
# $$
# 
# Let $X = \sigma Z + \mu$ for constants $\mu$ and $\sigma$ with $\sigma > 0$. Then for any real number $x$, the density of $X$ is
# 
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# f_X(x) ~ &= ~ \phi\big{(} \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \big{)} \frac{1}{\sigma} \\ \\
# &= ~ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma} e^{-\frac{1}{2} \big{(} \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \big{)}^2} 
# \end{align*}
# $$
# 
# Thus every normal random variable is a linear transformation of a standard normal variable. 

# ```{admonition} Quick Check
# Let $X$ have the normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $90$. Write $X$ as a linear function of a standard normal random variable.
# 
# ```

# ```{admonition} Answer
# :class: dropdown
# $X = \sqrt{90}Z$ where $Z$ is $X$ in standard units and hence standard normal
# 
# ```

# ### The Uniform Densities, Revisited ###
# Let the distribution of $U$ be uniform on $(0, 1)$ and for constants $b > a$ let $V = (b-a)U + a$. In an earlier section we saw that $V$ has the uniform distribution on $(a, b)$. But let's see what's involved in confirming that result using our new formula.
# 
# First it is a good idea to be clear about the possible values of $V$. Since the possible values of $U$ are in $(0, 1)$, the possible values of $V$ are in $(a, b)$.
# 
# At $v \in (a, b)$, the density of $V$ is
# 
# $$
# f_V(v) ~ = ~ f_U\big{(} \frac{v - a}{b-a} \big{)} \frac{1}{b-a} ~ = ~
# 1 \cdot \frac{1}{b-a} ~ = ~ \frac{1}{b-a}
# $$
# 
# That's the uniform density on $(a, b)$.
