# ## Monotone Functions ##

# If $X$ is discrete, and $g$ is a monotone function, then finding the distribution of the random variable $Y = g(X)$ is straightforward: convert each possible value of $X$ by applying $g$ and leave the probabilities alone.
# 
# For example, if $X$ is uniform on the three values $0, 1, 2$, and $Y = e^X$, then the you can just augment the distribution table of $X$ by the possible values of $Y$: 
# 
# |$y$   |$1$          |$e$          |$e^2$          |
# |-----:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
# |$x$   |$0$         |$1$          |$2$          |
# |chance|$\frac{1}{3}$|$\frac{1}{3}$|$\frac{1}{3}$|
# 
# The new random variable $Y$ is uniform on the three values $1, e, e^2$.
# 
# But if $X$ has a density then both $X$ and $Y$ have a continuum of values and we have to be more careful.

# The method we developed in the previous section for finding the density of a linear function of a random variable can be extended to non-linear functions.

# ### Change of Variable Formula for Density: Increasing Function ###
# The function $F^{-1}$ is differentiable and increasing. We will now develop a general method for finding the density of such a function applied to any random variable that has a density.
# 
# Let $X$ have density $f_X$. Let $g$ be a smooth (that is, differentiable) increasing function, and let $Y = g(X)$. Examples of such functions $g$ are:
# 
# - $g(x) = ax + b$ for some $a > 0$. This case was covered in the previous section.
# - $g(x) = e^x$
# - $g(x) = \sqrt{x}$ on positive values of $x$
# 
# To develop a formula for the density of $Y$ in terms of $f_X$ and $g$, we will start with the cdf as we did above.
# 
# Let $g$ be smooth and increasing, and let $Y = g(X)$. We want a formula for $f_Y$. We will start by finding a formula for the cdf $F_Y$ of $Y$ in terms of $g$ and the cdf $F_X$ of $X$.
# 
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# F_Y(y) ~ & = ~ P(Y \le y) \\
# &= ~ P(g(X) \le y) \\
# &= ~ P(X \le g^{-1}(y)) ~~~~ \text{because } g \text{ is increasing} \\
# &= ~ F_X(g^{-1}(y))
# \end{align*}
# $$
# 
# Now we can differentiate to find the density of $Y$. By the chain rule and the fact that the derivative of an inverse is the reciprocal of the derivative,
# 
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# f_Y(y) ~ &= ~ f_X(g^{-1}(y)) \frac{d}{dy} g^{-1}(y) \\
# &= ~ f_X(x) \frac{1}{g'(x)} ~~~~~ \text{at } x = g^{-1}(y)
# \end{align*}
# $$
# 
# #### The Formula ####
# Let $g$ be a differentiable, increasing function. The density of $Y = g(X)$ is given by
# 
# $$
# f_Y(y) ~ = ~ \frac{f_X(x)}{g'(x)} ~~~ \text{at } x = g^{-1}(y)
# $$

# ### Understanding the Formula ###
# To see what is going on in the calculation, we will follow the same process as we used for linear functions in an earlier section.
# - For $Y$ to be $y$, $X$ has to be $g^{-1}(y)$.
# - Since $g$ need not be linear, the tranformation by $g$ won't necessarily stretch the horizontal axis by a constant factor. Instead, the factor has different values at each $x$. If $g'$ denotes the derivative of $g$, then the stretch factor at $x$ is $g'(x)$, the rate of change of $g$ at $x$. To make the total area under the density equal to 1, we have to compensate by dividing by $g'(x)$. This is valid because $g$ is increasing and hence $g'$ is positive.
# 
# This gives us an intuitive justification for the formula.

# ### Applying the Formula ###
# Let $X$ have the exponential (1/2) density and let $Y = \sqrt{X}$. We can take the square root because $X$ is a positive random variable. 
# 
# Let's find the density of $Y$ by applying the formula we have derived above. We will organize our calculation in four preliminary steps, and then plug into the formula.
# 
# - **The density of the original random variable:** The density of $X$ is $f_X(x) = (1/2)e^{-(1/2)x}$ for $x > 0$.
# - **The function being applied to the original random variable:** Take $g(x) = \sqrt{x}$. Then $g$ is increasing and its possible values are $(0, \infty)$.
# - **The inverse function:** Let $y = g(x) = \sqrt{x}$. We will now write $x$ in terms of $y$, to get $x = y^2$.
# - **The derviative:** The derivative of $g$ is given by $g'(x) = 1/(2\sqrt{x})$.
# 
# We are ready to plug this into our formula. Keep in mind that the possible values of $Y$ are $(0, \infty)$. For $y > 0$ the formula says
# 
# $$
# f_Y(y) ~ = ~ \frac{f_X(x)} {g'(x)} ~~~ \text{at } x = g^{-1}(y)
# $$
# 
# So for $y > 0$,
# 
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# f_Y(y) ~ &= ~ \frac{(1/2)e^{-\frac{1}{2}x}}{1/(2\sqrt{x})} ~~~~ \mbox{at } x = y^2 \\
# &= ~ \sqrt{x} e^{-\frac{1}{2}x} ~~~~ \mbox{at } x = y^2 \\
# &= ~ \sqrt{y^2} e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2} \\
# &= ~ y e^{-\frac{1}{2}y^2}
# \end{align*}
# $$
# 
# This is called the *Rayleigh* density. Its graph is shown below.

# ### Change of Variable Formula for Density: Monotone Function ###
# Let $g$ be smooth and monotone (that is, either increasing or decreasing). The density of $Y = g(X)$ is given by
# 
# $$
# f_Y(y) ~ = ~ \frac{f_X(x)}{\lvert g'(x) \rvert} ~~~ \text{at } x = g^{-1}(y)
# $$
# 
# We have proved the result for increasing $g$. When $g$ is decreasing, the proof is analogous to proof in the linear case and accounts for $g'$ being negative. We won't take the time to write it out.

# ### Reciprocal of a Uniform Variable ###
# Let $U$ be uniform on $(0, 1)$ and let $V = 1/U$. The distribution of $V$ is called the *inverse uniform* but the word "inverse" is confusing in the context of change of variable. So we will simply call $V$ the reciprocal of $U$.
# 
# To find the density of $V$, start by noticing that the possible values of $V$ are in $(1, \infty)$ as the possible values of $U$ are in $(0, 1)$.
# 
# The components of the change of variable formula for densities:
# - **The original density:** $f_U(u) = 1$ for $0 < u < 1$.
# - **The function:** Define $g(u) = 1/u$.
# - **The inverse function:** Let $v = g(u) = 1/u$. Then $u = g^{-1}(v) = 1/v$.
# - **The derivative:** Then $g'(u) = -u^{-2}$.
# 
# By the formula, for $v > 1$ we have
# 
# $$
# f_V(v) ~ = ~ \frac{f_U(u)}{\lvert g'(u) \rvert} ~~~ \text{at } u = g^{-1}(v)
# $$
# 
# That is, for $v > 1$,
# 
# $$
# f_V(v) ~ = ~ 1 \cdot u^2 ~~~ \text{at } u = 1/v
# $$
# 
# So 
# 
# $$
# f_V(v) ~ = ~ \frac{1}{v^2}, ~~~ v > 1
# $$
# 
# You should check that $f_V$ is indeed a density, that is, it integrates to 1. You should also check that the expectation of $V$ is infinite.
# 
# The density $f_V$ belongs to the *Pareto* family of densities, much used in economics.
