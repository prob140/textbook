But that doesn't work. Each row of $\\mathbb{P}$ sums to 1, and hence each row of $\\mathbb{I} - \\mathbb{P}$ sums to 0, which means that $\\mathbb{I} - \\mathbb{P}$ is not invertible. \n",
    "\n",
    "So there are multiple solutions of the balance equations. We can see this easily by noting that if any vector solves the balance equations, then 10 times that vector also solves them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our job is to find the solution *that is also a probability distribution*. That's the steady state vector $\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $s$ denote the number of elements in the state space $S$. Then $\\pi$ is a row vector of length $s$. The $j$th element of $\\pi$ is $\\pi(j)$ and corresponds to the $j$th element of the state space.\n",

    "- The equations say that for each state $j$, $\\pi(j)$ is equal to the dot product of $\\pi$ and the $j$th column of $\\mathbb{P}$.\n",
    "- There are therefore $s$ equations with the additional condition that $\\sum_{j \\in S} \\pi(j) = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many examples, there is an efficient way of solving these equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try to manipulate each balance equation so that you can write each $\\pi(j)$ in terms of the same element of $\\pi$. For example, you might be able to simplify the equations to see that $\\pi = [\\pi(1), c_2\\pi(1), c_3\\pi(1), \\ldots, c_s\\pi(1)]$ where $c_2, c_3, \\ldots, c_s$ are constants you have determined from the balance equations.\n",
    "- Then solve for that key element of $\\pi$ by using the fact that the elements of $\\pi$ sum to 1. In the example above, $(1 + c_1 + c_2 + \\cdots + c_s)\\pi(1) = 1$, so you can solve for $\\pi(1)$. By plugging this value into the expression for $\\pi$ above, you get the entire vector $\\pi$.\n",
