# ## Functions on an Outcome Space ##

# Random sampling can be thought of as repeated random trials, and therefore many outcome spaces consist of sequences. An outcome space representing two tosses of a coin is
# 
# $$ 
# \Omega = \{ HH, HT, TH, TT \}
# $$
# 
# If you were tossing 10 times, the outcome space would consist of the $2^{10}$ sequences of 10 elements where each element is H or T. The outcomes are a pain to list by hand, but computers are good at saving us that kind of pain.

# ### Product Spaces ###
# The *product* of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of all pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. This concept is exactly what we need to describe spaces representing multiple trials.
# 
# For example, the space representing the outcome of one toss of a coin is $\Omega_1 = \{ H, T \}$. The *product* of $\Omega_1$ with itself is the set of pairs $(H, H)$, $(H, T)$, $(T, H)$, and $(T, T)$, which you will recognize as the outcomes of two tosses of a coin. The product of this new space and $\Omega_1$ is the space representing three tosses. And so on.
# 
# The Python module `itertools` contains a function `product` that constructs product spaces. Let's import it.

# In[2]:


from itertools import product


# To see how `product` works, we will start with the outcomes of one toss of a coin. We are creating an array using `make_array` but you could use any other way of creating an array or list.

# In[3]:


one_toss = make_array('H', 'T')


# To use `product`, we have to specify the base space and the number of repetitions, and then covert the result to a list.

# In[4]:


two_tosses = list(product(one_toss, repeat=2))
two_tosses


# For three tosses, just change the number of repetitions:

# In[5]:


three_tosses = list(product(one_toss, repeat=3))
three_tosses


# ### Probability Space ###
# A *probability space* is an outcome space accompanied by the probabilities of all the outcomes. If you assume all eight outcomes of three tosses are equally likely, the probabilities are all 1/8:

# In[6]:


three_toss_probs = (1/8)*np.ones(8)


# The corresponding probability space:

# In[7]:


three_toss_space = Table().with_columns(
    'omega', three_tosses,
    'P(omega)', three_toss_probs
)
three_toss_space


# Product spaces get large very quickly. If you roll a die 5 times, there are almost 8,000 possible outcomes:

# In[8]:


6**5


# But we have `product` so we can still list them all! Here is a probability space representing 5 rolls of a die.

# In[9]:


die = np.arange(1, 7, 1)

five_rolls = list(product(die, repeat=5))  # All possible results of 5 rolls

five_rolls_probs = (1/6**5)**np.ones(6**5)  # Each result has chance 1/6**5

five_rolls_space = Table().with_columns(
   'omega', five_rolls,
    'P(omega)', five_rolls_probs
)

five_rolls_space

# ### A Function on the Outcome Space ###
# Suppose you roll a die five times and add up the number of spots you see. If that seems artificial, be patient for a moment and you'll soon see why it's interesting. 
# 
# The sum of the rolls is a numerical function on the outcome space $\Omega$ of five rolls. The sum is thus a *random variable*. Let's call it $S$. Then, formally,
# 
# $$
# S: \Omega \rightarrow \{ 5, 6, \ldots, 30 \}
# $$
# 
# The range of $S$ is the integers 5 through 30, because each die shows at least one spot and at most six spots. We can also use the equivalent notation
# 
# $$
# \Omega \stackrel{S}{\rightarrow} \{ 5, 6, \ldots, 30 \}
# $$

# From a computational perspective, the elements of $\Omega$ are in the column `omega` of `five_roll_space`. Let's apply this function and create a larger table.

# In[11]:


five_rolls_sum = five_rolls_space.with_columns(
    'S(omega)', five_rolls_space.apply(sum, 'omega')
).move_to_end('P(omega)')

five_rolls_sum


# We now have every possible outcome of five rolls of a die, along with its total number of spots. You can see that the first row of the table shows the smallest possible number of spots, corresponding to all the rolls showing 1 spot. The 7776th row shows the largest:

# In[12]:


five_rolls_sum.take(7775)


# All the other values of $S$ are between these two extremes. 

# ```{admonition} Quick Check
# A standard probability space for three tosses of a coin consists of the outcome space $\Omega = \{ HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT \}$ with equally likely outcomes. For each of the following descriptions, say whether or not it results in a random variable defined on $\Omega$.
# 
# (i) Count $1$ if the outcome in $HHH$, $0$ otherwise
# 
# (ii) Note the index of the final toss on which $H$ appears
# ```

# ```{admonition} Answer
# :class: dropdown
# (i) Yes.
# 
# (ii) No. The description gets stuck at the outcome $TTT$. It doesn't say what to do in this case. Even if you decide to use $\infty$ for this outcome, you don't get a random variable because $\infty$ isn't a real number.
# ```

# **Functions of Random Variables**
# 
# A random variable is a numerical function on $\Omega$. Therefore by composition, a numerical function of a random variable is also a random variable. 
# 
# For example, $S^2$ is a random variable, calculated as follows:
# 
# $$
# S^2(\omega) = \big{(} S(\omega)\big{)}^2
# $$
# 
# Thus for example $S^2(\text{[6 6 6 6 6]}) = 30^2 = 900$.

# ```{admonition} Quick Check
# Let $X$ and $Y$ be random variables defined on the same probability space.
# 
# (a) Is $\max(X, Y)$ a random variable?
# 
# (b) Let $Z = 1$ if $X=Y$ and $Z=0$ otherwise. Is $Z$ a random variable?
# ```

# ```{admonition} Answer
# :class: dropdown
# (a) Yes (b) Yes

# ### Events Determined by $S$ ###
# From the table `five_rolls_sum` it is hard to tell how many rows show a sum of 6, or 10, or any other value. To better understand the properties of $S$, we have to organize the information in `five_rolls_sum`.
# 
# For any subset $A$ of the range of $S$, define the event $\{S \in A\}$ as
# 
# $$
# \{S \in A \} = \{\omega: S(\omega) \in A \}
# $$
# 
# That is, $\{ S \in A\}$ is the collection of all $\omega$ for which $S(\omega)$ is in $A$. In terms of the table, the set consists of the values of $\omega$ in all the rows in which the sum is in $A$.
# 
# Events of the form $\{ S \in A\}$ are said to be *determined by $S$*. If we know the value of $S$, then we know whether or not that value is in $A$. So we can determine whether or not the event $\{ S \in A\}$ has occurred.
# 
# Let's try out the definition in a special case. Take $A = \{5, 30\}$. Then $\{S \in A\}$ if and only if either all the rolls show 1 spot or all the rolls show 6 spots. So 
# 
# $$
# \{S \in A\} = \{\text{[1 1 1 1 1], [6 6 6 6 6]}\}
# $$
# 
# It is natural to ask about the chance the sum is a particular value, say 10. That's not easy to read off the table, but we can access the corresponding rows:

# In[14]:


five_rolls_sum.where('S(omega)', are.equal_to(10))


# There are 126 values of $\omega$ for which $S(\omega) = 10$. Since all the $\omega$ are equally likely, the chance that $S$ has the value 10 is 126/7776. 
# 
# We will usually be informal with notation and write $\{ S = 10 \}$ instead of $\{ S \in \{10\} \}$:
# 
# $$
# P(S = 10) = \frac{126}{7776} = 1.62\%
# $$

# ```{admonition} Quick Check
# Consider a probability space representing two rolls of a die. That is the space consists of the 36 equally likely pairs $(i,j)$ where $1 \le i, j \le 6$. Let $X_1$ be the result of the first roll and $X_2$ the result of the second, and let $D = X_1 - X_2$. Here are two events determined by $D$. Write them as subsets of the outcome space and find their probabilities.
# 
# (a) $D = 0$
# 
# (b) $D > 3$
# ```

# ```{admonition} Answer
# :class: dropdown
# (a) $\{ (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6) \}$, probability $6/36$
# 
# (b) $\{ (5,1), (6,1), (6,2) \}$, probability $3/36$
