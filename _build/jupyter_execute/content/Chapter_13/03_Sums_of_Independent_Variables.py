# ## Sums of Independent Variables ##

# After the dry, algebraic discussion of the previous section it is a relief to finally be able to compute some variances.

# ### The Variance of a Sum ###
# 
# Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots X_n$ be random variables with sum
# 
# $$
# S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i
# $$
# 
# The variance of the sum is
# 
# $$
# \begin{align*}
# Var(S_n) &= Cov(S_n, S_n) \\
# &= \sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n Cov(X_i, X_j) ~~~~ \text{(bilinearity)} \\
# &= \sum_{i=1}^n Var(X_i) + \mathop{\sum \sum}_{1 \le i \ne j \le n} Cov(X_i, X_j)
# \end{align*}
# $$
# 
# We say that *the variance of the sum is the sum of all the variances and all the covariances*.
# 
# - The first sum has $n$ terms.
# - The second sum has $n(n-1)$ terms.
# 
# Since $Cov(X_i, X_j) = Cov(X_j, X_i)$, the second sum can be written as $2\mathop{\sum \sum}_{1 \le i < j \le n} Cov(X_i, X_j)$. But we will use the form given above.

# ### Sum of Independent Random Variables ###
# 
# If $X_1, X_2 \ldots , X_n$ are independent, then all the covariance terms in the formula above are 0. 
# 
# Therefore if $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are independent, then
# 
# $$
# Var(S_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n Var(X_i)
# $$
# 
# Thus for independent random variables $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$, both the expectation and the variance add up nicely:
# 
# $$
# E(S_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n E(X_i), ~~~~~~ Var(S_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n Var(X_i)
# $$
# 
# When the random variables are i.i.d., this simplifies even further.

# VIDEO: Variance of IID Sample Sum

YouTubeVideo('jHcdiO5N0ng')


# ### Sum of an IID Sample ###
# Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be i.i.d., each with mean $\mu$ and $SD$ $\sigma$. You can think of $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ as draws at random with replacement from a population, or the results of independent replications of the same experiment.
# 
# Let $S_n$ be the sample sum, as above. Then
# 
# $$
# E(S_n) = n\mu ~~~~~~~~~~ Var(S_n) = n\sigma^2 ~~~~~~~~~~ SD(S_n) = \sqrt{n}\sigma
# $$
# 
# This implies that as the sample size $n$ increases, the distribution of the sum $S_n$ shifts to the right and is more spread out. The expectation goes up linearly in $n$, but the SD goes up more slowly.

# ```{admonition} Quick Check
# Suppose the sizes of $100$ random households are i.i.d. with expectation $2.5$ and SD $1.9$. Let $S$ be the total number of people in all $100$ households, that is, the sum of all the household sizes.
# 
# (a) Pick one of the following values for $E(S)$: $25$, $250$, $2500$
# 
# (b) Pick one of the following values for $SD(S)$: $19$, $190$, $1900$
# 
# 
# ```

# ```{admonition} Answer
# :class: dropdown
# (a) $250$
# 
# (b) $19$
# 
# ```

# Here is an important application of the formula for the variance of an i.i.d. sample sum.

# ### Variance of the Binomial ###
# Let $X$ have the binomial $(n, p)$ distribution. We know that 
# 
# $$
# X = \sum_{j=1}^n I_j
# $$
# 
# where $I_1, I_2, \ldots, I_n$ are i.i.d. indicators, each taking the value 1 with probability $p$. Each of these indicators has expectation $p$ and variance $pq = p(1-p)$. Therefore
# 
# $$
# E(X) = np ~~~~~~~~~~ Var(X) = npq ~~~~~~~~~~ SD(X) = \sqrt{npq}
# $$
# 
# For example, if $X$ is the number of heads in 100 tosses of a coin, then
# 
# $$
# E(X) = 100 \times 0.5 = 50 ~~~~~~~~~~ SD(X) = \sqrt{100 \times 0.5 \times 0.5} = 5
# $$
# 
# Here is the distribution of $X$. You can see that there is almost no probability outside the range $E(X) \pm 3SD(X)$.

# In[4]:


k = np.arange(25, 75, 1)
binom_probs = stats.binom.pmf(k, 100, 0.5)
binom_dist = Table().values(k).probabilities(binom_probs)
Plot(binom_dist, show_ev=True, show_sd=True)

# VIDEO: Binomial and Poisson Variance

YouTubeVideo('KoWHPWJBeJo')


# ### Variance of the Poisson, Revisited ###
# 
# We showed earlier that if $X$ has the Poisson $(\mu)$ distribution then $E(X) = \mu$, $Var(X) = \mu$, and $SD(X) = \sqrt{\mu}$. Now we have a way to understand the formula for the SD.
# 
# One way in which a Poisson $(\mu)$ distribution can arise is as an approximation to a binomial $(n, p)$ distribution where $n$ is large, $p$ is small, and $np = \mu$. The expectation of the binomial becomes the parameter of the approximating Poisson distribution, which is also the expectation of the Poisson.
# 
# Now let's compare the standard deviations. The standard deviation of the binomial is
# 
# $$
# \sqrt{npq} ~ \approx ~ \sqrt{np} ~~~ \text{ because the small } p \text{ implies } q \approx 1
# $$
# 
# But $np = \mu$ in this setting, so the SD of the binomial is approximately $\sqrt{\mu}$. That's the SD of its approximating Poisson $(\mu)$ distribution.
