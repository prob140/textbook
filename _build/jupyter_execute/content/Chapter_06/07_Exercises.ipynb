    "**12.** The Early Start Denver Model (EDSM) is a developmental behavioral intervention for toddlers diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. In a [randomized controlled trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4951085/) to evaluate the efficacy of ESDM, 48 children were assigned randomly to an ESDM group and a control group. \n",

    "You can assume that a simple random sample of 24 children was chosen for the ESDM group and the remainder for the control group. In this exercise you will analyze some of the data from the study using [Fisher's Exact Test](http://prob140.org/textbook/content/Chapter_06/03_Hypergeometric_Distribution.html#fisher-s-exact-test), one of the primary tools used in the paper.\n",

Explain where the difference comes from and show how the value of $0.461$ arises.\n",
