    "### Aperiodicity ###\n",
    "Working in discrete time has disadvantages. One of them is that states can be *periodic*. Let's start with the example of a random walk where the steps are based on tosses of a fair coin. Suppose the walk starts at state 0. Then it can return to 0 only at even times: the number of heads up to that point has to exactly equal the number of tails, and thus the number of tosses has to be even. We say that the state 0 *has period 2.* \n",
    "\n",
    "A state $i$ has *period* $d$ if, starting at $i$, the chain can come back to $i$ only at times that are multiples of $d$. That is, $d$ is the greatest common divisor of the set all $n$ such that $P_n(i, i) > 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the random walk described above, all states have period 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Period causes trouble with statements about long-run behavior. For example, if state $i$ has period 3, then the sequence $P_n(i, i)$ might look like \"0, 0, positive, 0, 0, positive, $\\ldots$\", so limit statements might become complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will study the long run behavior of chains in which all states are *aperiodic*, that is, they have period 1. In other words there is no cyclical pattern to when the chain can return to any state. \n",
    "\n",
    "How do you check if all states are aperiodic? If the chain is irreducible, it turns out that all the states must have the same period. The proof of this fact isn't terribly hard but we won't go through it. What it implies is that if a chain is irreducible, which is easy to check, all you have to do is figure out the period of one of its states. Then all the others must have the same period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A way to establish aperiodicity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some states are easy to identify as aperiodic. If the one-step transition probability $P(i, i)$ is positive, then the state $i$ has to be aperiodic. Since the chain can stay at $i$ for arbitrary lengths of time, it cannot have a cyclical pattern in how it returns to a state.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have an irreducible chain, it's a good idea to look on the diagonal of the transition matrix. If you see a non-zero element on the diagonal, the chain is aperiodic.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's not a necessary condition for the chain to be aperiodic, but it's sufficient and very easy to spot."
