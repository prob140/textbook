    "We will assume for now that $\\Omega$ is finite. In a sense this is not restrictive, as even the largest data sets are finite and the most powerful computers perform finitely many operations per task. However, we will soon see that allowing infinitely many possible outcomes not only results in a rich and elegant theory but also gives us deeper insights into problems involving finite outcome spaces. So the assumption that $\\Omega$ is finite will be lifted in later chapters, once we have acquired some fluency with working in the finite case.\n",

By convention, early letters of the alphabet like $A$ and $B$ are commonly used as notation for events. Also by convention, we will denote sets by enclosing their elements in braces $\\{ \\}$."
