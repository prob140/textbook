    "### Example 3: Second Random Digit Greater than the First ###\n",

    "**Question.** What is the chance that the second digit is greater than the first?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer, Method II: Symmetry.** Convince yourself of some symmetry: the chance that the second digit is greater than the first is the same as the chance that the first digit is greater than the second. One way to do this is to partition the second event according to the value of the second digit and notice the correspondence with the partition in Method I.\n",
