It's due to our premise that the person \"is picked at random from the population.\" The disease is so rare that the proportion of people who have the disease and test positive is actually a bit smaller than the people who don't have the disease and get a bad test result. This explains why the answer for a randomly picked person is less than 50%.\n",
