    "\"The number of trials till the first success\" provides the framework for a rich array of examples, because both \"trial\" and \"success\" can be defined to be much more complex than just tossing a coin and getting heads. A classic example is about a professor (or a monkey) drawing independently at random from the 26 letters of the alphabet to see if they ever get the sequence `datascience`. They will, with probability 1, as you can see by overestimating the number of draws they have to make.\n",
    "- Define a \"trial\" to be 11 letters picked at random.\n",
    "- Define a trial to be a \"success\" if those 11 letters are the sequence `datascience`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the number of trials till `datascience` appears has the geometric distribution with parameter $p = 1/26^{11}$, and therefore has expectation $26^{11}$. That's $26^{11}$ lots of 11 draws, which is an overestimate because you will be watching the draws sequentially and not in blocks of 11. For example, if the first block of 11 ends in `data` and the next block starts with `science`, you will have seen the sequence `datascience` and stopped watching, even though both of those blocks would be called failures and the trials would continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is nothing special about the sequence `datascience`. You can replace it with any finite string of letters, no matter how long. For example, the string could be the complete works of Shakespeare. You will just have to replace 11 by the length of the string. This is popularly known as the [Infinite Monkey Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem)."
