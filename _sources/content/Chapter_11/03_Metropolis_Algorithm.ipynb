The algorithm starts this process off by picking a decoder $j$ according to $\\mathbb{Q}$. We say that *$\\mathbb{Q}$ proposes a move to $j$*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide whether or not the chain should move to $j$, remember that the distribution $\\pi$ contains the likelihoods of all the decoders. You want to end up with decoders that have high likelihood, so it is natural to compare $\\pi(i)$ and $\\pi(j)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm does this by comparing the *acceptance ratio* $r(i, j) = \\pi(j)/\\pi(i)$ to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If $r(i, j) \\ge 1$, the likelihood of $j$ is at least as large that of $i$, so you *accept the proposal* and move to $j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If $r(i, j) < 1$, the proposed decoder $j$ has *less* likelihood than the current $i$, so it is tempting to stay at $i$. But this risks the chain getting stuck at a local maximum. The algorithm provides a chance to avoid this, by tossing a biased coin. If the coin lands heads, the chain moves to $j$ even though $j$ has a *lower* likelihood than the current decoder $i$. The idea is that from this new position there might be paths to decoders that have the highest likelihoods of all."
